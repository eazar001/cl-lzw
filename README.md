# cl-lzw
This is a Common LISP package that implements the LZW compression algorithm. This library doesn't aim to be the most efficient, 
effective, or even well-rounded implementation of LZW. I merely once needed to decompress resources for another project which 
compressed graphics using this method. At the time of writing, there was no third-party Quicklisp package for it, so I wrote this.

The basic functionality is done and is all I need, so be warned that this library is most likely not suitable for your use-case.
Nonetheless, feel free to use/adapt this work if you somehow find it useful. Further work on this project is possible in the
future, but definitely by no means guaranteed.
